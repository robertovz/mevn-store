# Vue CLI 3 Plugin for Bootstrap 4

Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework. Using this Vue CLI 3 plugin you can quickly add the latest Bootstrap 4 version in your Vue project. The plugin will take care of adding any configuration options and install the dependencies into your project so you can start using Bootstrap classes right away without spending time figuring out what settings or dependencies you need to add.

In a Vue project, you have many options when ot comes to add Bootstrap, let's see them one by one:

- You can use the official Bootstrap 4 files which requires jQuery and Pepper.js
- Or you can use bootstrap-vue which provides an implementation for Bootstrap components in vanilla JavaScript which means you don't need the jQuery.js dependency   

The plugin will support both options.
